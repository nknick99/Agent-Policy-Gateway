# Agent Policy Gateway

Deterministic policy enforcement gateway that sits between AI agents and target systems (databases, APIs, cloud services). Every action an agent attempts is evaluated against an immutable JSON allowlist — permitted or denied in under 1ms. No LLM in the enforcement path.

### Enforcement Pipeline

Every request passes through a fixed-order pipeline. If any stage fails, the request is denied and the pipeline halts.

```
authenticate → schema validate → policy evaluate → egress control →
quota check → credential mint → execute action → filter response → audit
```

1. **Authentication** — Bearer token verified via HMAC constant-time comparison
2. **Schema validation** — JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope structure check (tools themselves are validated by policy, not a fixed registry)
3. **Policy evaluation** — tool allowed? operation permitted? keywords blocked?
4. **Egress control** — destination in allowlist? not in deny list?
5. **Quota check** — within per-session rate limits?
6. **Credential mint** — optional: `credential_broker: none` (default) or `aws_sts` for short-lived per-action AWS credentials (15min TTL)
7. **Execute** — action forwarded to the real target (per-tool `target_url` or `APG_TARGET_URL`); fails closed if no target is configured
8. **Response filter** — redact secrets/PII (SSN, AWS keys, JWTs, private keys)
9. **Credential discard** — memory zeroed immediately (when a broker minted credentials)
10. **Audit** — append-only structured log with correlation ID

The pipeline is a single implementation (`core/pipeline.py`) with injected
ports for execution, credential brokering, and audit. The `/rpc` endpoint,
the CLI proxy, and the live demo all run through it — there is no second
enforcement engine (see `docs/adr/002-deterministic-policy-scope.md`).

### Zero Trust Principles

- **Default deny** — nothing is allowed unless explicitly in the policy; unknown tools are denied by policy, not by a hardcoded method list
- **Least privilege** — with `aws_sts`, credentials are scoped to exactly one action
- **No standing access** — minted credentials live for milliseconds, not minutes
- **Assume breach** — agents hold zero secrets; compromised agent = zero escalation
- **Full audit** — every decision logged with correlation IDs

---

## Services

A modular monolith (see `docs/adr/001-modular-monolith.md`): one backend
process serves the gateway, auth, and demo APIs.

| Service | Port | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Frontend** (Next.js) | 3000 | Dashboard UI — login, pipeline visualization, demos |
| **Backend** (FastAPI) | 8000 | Policy enforcement, STS mint, egress control, audit, JWT auth, demo scenarios |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Audit logs, user accounts |
| **Floci** (AWS emulator) | 4566 | STS credential minting (dev); real AWS in prod |

## Quick Start

### Install (pip)

```bash
pip install agent-policy-gateway          # core CLI, zero infra
pip install "agent-policy-gateway[aws]"   # + AWS STS credential broker (optional)

apg init                                  # write a starter policy.json
apg policy validate policy.json           # confirm it loads and is default-deny
apg proxy --target http://localhost:9000 --policy policy.json
```

The core install has no AWS dependency — the happy path (proxy, `wrap`, policy
tooling, audit) needs no cloud services. The dashboard is an optional separate
app (see Docker below).

### Docker (one command)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — login with `admin@apg.dev` / `apg-demo` / workspace `apg`
(the compose file stores the demo password as an argon2 hash, not plaintext;
change it for anything real via `apg hash-password`).

### Without Docker

```bash
# Backend
export APG_AGENT_TOKEN="test-token"
python -m uvicorn agent_policy_gateway.main:app --port 8000 --reload

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

### CLI (standalone proxy)

```bash
pip install -e .
apg proxy --target http://localhost:9000 --policy policy.json --token my-secret
```

Point your MCP client at the gateway instead of the target server. Every
request must carry `Authorization: Bearer my-secret`; allowed calls are
forwarded to the target, denied calls are blocked before it. No database,
no AWS, no frontend required.

### CLI (stdio MCP server)

Most MCP servers run over stdio — the client spawns them as a subprocess.
`apg wrap` inserts the gateway into that pipe:

```bash
apg wrap --policy policy.json -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /data
```

Point your MCP client at `apg wrap -- <command>` as if it were the server. APG
spawns the real server as its child and enforces policy on every `tools/call`:
allowed calls (and all `initialize`/`tools/list` traffic) are forwarded
verbatim; denied calls are answered with a JSON-RPC error and never reach the
child. There's no network boundary, so no bearer token is needed — the trust
boundary is the process spawn. stdout is the JSON-RPC channel; APG's own logs
go to stderr. Add `--mode audit` to log denials without blocking (pair it with
`apg policy suggest`).

### Policy tooling

```bash
# Check a policy loads, validates, and is default-deny (CI-friendly)
apg policy validate policy.json

# Unit-test a policy: run allow/deny assertions through the real engine.
# Exits non-zero on any failure — wire it into CI.
apg policy test policy.test.yaml

# Learning mode: after running the proxy in --mode audit, mine the audit
# log for blocked calls and print ready-to-paste allowlist entries.
apg policy suggest --audit-file apg-audit.jsonl --policy policy.json
```

`apg policy test` reads YAML cases (see `policy.test.yaml`):

```yaml
cases:
  - name: a normal SELECT is allowed
    method: db.query
    params: {op: select, query: "SELECT name FROM users"}
    expect: allow
  - name: DROP is blocked
    method: db.query
    params: {op: drop}
    expect: deny
```

`apg policy suggest` prints a `tools` snippet to stdout (commentary goes to
stderr, so it pipes cleanly). Suggestions are deterministic and additive —
it only proposes the minimal new permissions the observed traffic needed, and
never loosens what the policy already allows.

---

## Policy

The policy is a JSON allowlist loaded at startup. Maps directly to MCP `tools/call` requests:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "default": "deny",
  "credential_broker": "none",
  "tools": {
    "db.query": {
      "allow": true,
      "operations": ["select"],
      "tables": ["customers", "orders"],
      "sql": {"dialect": "", "params": ["query", "sql"]},
      "target_url": "http://localhost:9000/rpc"
    },
    "http.post": {
      "allow": true,
      "destination_whitelist": ["https://api.example.com"],
      "deny_destinations": ["169.254.169.254"],
      "deny_keywords": ["password", "secret"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `credential_broker`: `none` (default, zero external deps) or `aws_sts` to mint
  per-request scoped credentials. With `aws_sts`, add `aws_role` and
  `session_policy` per tool.
- `target_url`: per-tool execution target; falls back to the `APG_TARGET_URL`
  environment variable. If neither is set, an allowed request fails closed
  rather than returning fabricated data.
- `sql`: opt into real SQL parsing (via `sqlglot`). The SQL string found under
  one of `params` is parsed, and the `operations`/`tables` allowlists are
  enforced against the **parsed** operation and tables — not a self-declared
  `op` field or substring matching. This is deterministic and hard to fool:
  `SELECT ...; DROP TABLE x` is blocked on the piggybacked `DROP`, a `DROP`
  hidden in a `-- comment` is inert, and SQL that can't be parsed fails closed.
- `deny_keywords`: case-insensitive substring denial for **free-text** payloads
  (e.g. blocking `password`/`secret` in an `http.post` body). For SQL, prefer
  `sql` above — structured parsing beats keyword matching.

---

## Per-agent identity

By default the proxy uses a single shared token — one secret, one identity that
may call every tool. To run many agents through one gateway, add an `agents`
map: each agent authenticates with its own bearer token and is scoped to a
subset of tools. The per-tool rules (operations, tables, egress, SQL) are still
shared; identity decides only *which tools an agent may reach at all*.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "default": "deny",
  "tools": {
    "db.query":  { "allow": true, "operations": ["select"] },
    "http.post": { "allow": true, "destination_whitelist": ["https://api.example.com"] }
  },
  "agents": {
    "reporting":   { "token_env": "APG_TOKEN_REPORTING",   "tools": ["db.query"] },
    "provisioner": { "token_env": "APG_TOKEN_PROVISIONER", "tools": ["*"] }
  }
}
```

Each agent's token lives in the named environment variable (never in the policy
file). A request with the `reporting` token can call `db.query` but is denied
`http.post` with `Agent 'reporting' is not permitted to call 'http.post'`;
`"tools": ["*"]` grants every tool. Every audit event records the resolved
`agent_id`, so the trail attributes each action to a specific agent. With no
`agents` map, behavior is unchanged (single shared token).

> OIDC/SSO and per-agent JWT subjects slot in later behind the same
> `IdentityProvider` port — no change to the enforcement path.

---

## Operating Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Enforce** (default) | Denied requests are blocked. No execution. |
| **Audit** | Denied requests are logged but still executed. Use for gradual rollout. |

Set via `APG_MODE=enforce` or `APG_MODE=audit` (or `apg proxy --mode audit`).

Audit mode is also how you author a policy without guessing: run real traffic
through it, then `apg policy suggest` turns the logged denials into allowlist
entries you review and merge.

---

## Audit trail

Every request (proxy or `wrap`) writes one append-only audit event with a
correlation id, the decision, the rule/reason, and latency. The `--audit-file`
target picks the backend automatically:

| Target | Backend |
|--------|---------|
| `apg-audit.jsonl` (default) | JSONL — one JSON object per line, zero deps |
| `audit.db` / `*.sqlite` / `sqlite:///path.db` | SQLite — durable and indexed |

Inspect it with `apg audit tail` (works against either backend):

```bash
apg audit tail                                  # last 20 events
apg audit tail --audit-file audit.db --limit 50 # from a SQLite store
apg audit tail --outcome DENY                   # only denials
apg audit tail --follow                          # stream new events live
```

The audit trail is append-only — there is no update or delete path.

---

## Compliance

APG's controls (default-deny action policy, per-agent least privilege, egress
control, structured SQL enforcement, and the durable audit trail) map to common
AI-governance and security frameworks — NIST AI RMF, NIST SP 800-53, the EU AI
Act (Art. 12 logging / Art. 14 human oversight / Art. 15 robustness), and SOC 2
Common Criteria. See **[docs/compliance-mapping.md](docs/compliance-mapping.md)**
for the control-by-control mapping and how to produce evidence, along with an
honest statement of what APG does *not* cover.

---

## Performance

The **enforcement decision** (auth + policy + egress) is in-process and
sub-millisecond:

| Operation | Latency |
|---|---|
| Token verification (HMAC-SHA256) | ~0.02ms |
| Policy evaluation (ALLOW) | ~0.01ms |
| Policy evaluation (DENY) | ~0.003ms |

End-to-end request latency is dominated by the two things the decision does
*not* control: the network hop to the target (the Execute step) and, if
`credential_broker: aws_sts` is enabled, the STS `AssumeRole` call
(typically 50–200ms). Benchmark your own target; the enforcement overhead
APG adds on top is the numbers above.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APG_AGENT_TOKEN` | Bearer token for agent authentication |
| `APG_TARGET_URL` | Default execution target for allowed requests (per-tool `target_url` overrides) |
| `APG_MODE` | `enforce` or `audit` |
| `APG_REDIS_URL` | `redis://…` — use a shared Redis session/quota store (required for correct quotas across replicas). Unset → in-memory. Needs `pip install "agent-policy-gateway[redis]"` |
| `APG_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | Optional expiry for idle Redis sessions |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | STS endpoint (e.g. Floci/LocalStack); unset → real AWS. Only used with `credential_broker: aws_sts` |
| `APG_JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing operator JWTs (PyJWT, HS256; ≥32 bytes). No built-in default — required to issue/verify operator tokens |
| `APG_OPERATOR_EMAIL` | Operator login email (required; no default) |
| `APG_OPERATOR_WORKSPACE` | Workspace identifier (required; no default) |
| `APG_OPERATOR_PASSWORD_HASH` | argon2 hash of the operator password — generate with `apg hash-password` |
| `APG_OPERATOR_PASSWORD` | Plaintext operator password (dev-only fallback if no hash is set) |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `mock`, `ollama`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `microservice` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |

---

## Deploy to Kubernetes

> **Multi-replica note:** session/quota state is behind a `SessionStore` port.
> The default is in-memory (single process); set `APG_REDIS_URL` to use a shared
> Redis store so quotas are counted once across all replicas rather than N times
> (this was defect D7). The `k8s/` manifests still describe the pre-consolidation
> multi-service layout and need updating to the single backend image + a Redis
> service before re-publishing. See `k8s/README.md`. For now, use
> `docker compose up --build`.

Once updated, with `credential_broker: aws_sts`, remove `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`
from the backend env to use real AWS STS instead of a local emulator.
